					<span class="re">I</span> am a graduate of Bachelors in Computer Science from BRAC University. I am a quick learner as well as a hard worker.

				<p>
					 <span class="re">F</span>rom the very first moment of my student life, I was very serious about study and that is the main reason that I was able to study in my favorite subject. Though I am serious about my studies, I have some hobbies also. Playing and watching sports is one of them.

				<p> 
					  <span class="re">I</span> was a member of the Nature Study Club in our college. My favorite subjects were Math, ICT when I was in college. To take care of my expenses, I used to tutor students. During my university life, I worked as a teaching assistant and  had interests in Web development and Artificial Intelligence. I did my thesis on cyber-security and machine learning which was recently published in an international journal. I also was involved in many programming competitions, exams related to technical stuff. There I realized the importance of skills because without it, having a good result is nothing.

					<span class="re">S</span>o after graduating, my first intention was to enhance my skills in the technical field. I learned about 'Shikhbe Shobai' from a Facebook post where they opened some online courses. After knowing about the full-stack web development course I did not think for the second time as I learn about how important and trendy subject it is nowadays in the technical field. So I intended to complete the course with great enthusiasm so that in the future, I can see myself as a well-skilled web developer.
